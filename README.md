# New-York-City-Taxi-Trips-Analysis
Analysis of Trips made by New York Taxis between 2017 and 2018

### Project Overview
Welcome to my analytical journey through the bustling streets of New York City, as we delve into the intricate patterns and dynamics of taxi trips over the course of 2017 and 2018. This project aims to uncover the hidden narratives behind the millions of journeys that paint the ever-moving picture of this iconic metropolis.

Leveraging robust datasets, we will employ advanced data analysis techniques to dissect the ebb and flow of New York's taxi services. Our exploration will be powered by the latest tools in data analytics, including Power BI for compelling visualizations.

Key areas of focus will include:

  1. Temporal Trends: Identifying peak hours, days, and seasons for taxi usage.
  2. Spatial Analysis: Mapping the most frequented routes and hotspots within the city.
  3. Economic Insights: Estimating the financial impact of taxi services on the urban economy.
  4. Operational Efficiency: Assessing the effectiveness of current taxi dispatch and routing systems.

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights that could inform policy-making, enhance operational efficiencies, and improve the overall experience for both taxi operators and passengers alike. Join us as we navigate through the data, uncovering the pulse of New York City's streets through the lens of its taxi cabs.
